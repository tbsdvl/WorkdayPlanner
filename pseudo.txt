I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

I open the planner
    and the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

    HTML
    <div code...>
    <time code...>

    CSS
    .lead class
    
    Moment.js 
    Format time to current day
        moment().format("MMM Do YY"); 

I scroll down
    and I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

    HTML

    CSS
    .container Bootstrap class
    .time-block class




I view the timeblocks for that day
    and each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

I click into a timeblock
    and I can enter an event

I click the save button for that timeblock
    the text for that event is saved in local storage

I refresh the page
    andthe saved events persist
