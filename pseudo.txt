I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

I open the planner
    and the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

    HTML
    <div code...>
    <time code...>

    CSS
    .lead class

    Moment.js 
    Format time to current day
        moment().format("MMM Do YY"); 

I scroll down
    and I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

    HTML
    <ul>?
        <li>?
            <textarea>?

    CSS
    .container Bootstrap class
    .time-block class
        style list elements as blocks with formatted business hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) time text.
        Allow user to manipulate text inside the box 

    moment.js
    convert text to standard business hours
    function stdBusHrs ();
    var timeBlock = $("timeblock");

    for(i = 0; i > timeBlock.parent.length(); i++){
        if(i < 4){
            timeBlock.text(i + ":00 A.M.");
        }else if(i => 4){
            timeblock.text(i + ":00 P.M.");
        }else{
            null;
        };
    };
};

I view the timeblocks for that day
    and each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

    moment.js
    Compare hourly times with current time
    moment().format('LT');
    Need to convert hours to moment objects
    Time maths comparing the current time and different times
    if(current time is before a later hour)
        make the timeblock color of the later hours green
    else if(current time is after an earlier hour)
        make the timeblock color of the earlier hours red
    else if(current time is during the same hour)
        make the timeblock color for the current time grey


I click into a timeblock
    and I can enter an event

    HTML
    textarea
    textareas need to save text via .value

I click the save button for that timeblock
    the text for that event is saved in local storage

    js
    localStorage();
    localStorage.getId("of hour id");
    store text area .value

I refresh the page
    and the saved events persist

    js
    preventDefault();
    handleFormSubmit();
